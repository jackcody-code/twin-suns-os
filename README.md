# Twin Suns OS

Twin Suns OS is an internal backend system built to automate operations for a live, multi-location tattoo studio.

The system models appointment lifecycles with explicit domain rules, validates inputs, generates daily and weekly reports, calculates key business metrics, and surfaces operator alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

This project reflects how real internal tools and business systems are designed, tested, and evolved in production environments.
