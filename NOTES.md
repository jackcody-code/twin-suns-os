# Day 2 Notes

## What this system does
This script calculates daily business revenue from a list of appointments.

## Input
- An array of appointment objects
- Each appointment has a client name and price

## Process
- Uses `reduce()` to sum all appointment prices
- Validates data to avoid errors
- Formats the total as currency

## Output
- Logs total daily revenue as a number and formatted USD

## Why this matters
This same pattern applies to:
- Payroll
- Invoicing
- Sales reports
- Automation systems
## Day 3 – Modules & Separation of Concerns

I split the system into modules:
- data (appointments)
- services (business logic)
- utils (formatting)
- index.js (wiring)

This makes the system easier to test, change, and reuse.
## Day 4 – Configuration and Flexibility

Before today, numbers were hard-coded.

Today I added a config file and passed it into the system so those values aren’t stuck in the code.

I don’t 100% understand it yet, but now those numbers are flexible and easy to change.
## Day 5 – Testing & Trust

Today I added automated tests for the revenue system.

What I learned:
- Tests let me verify business logic instead of guessing
- I can run all tests with `node --test` or `npm test`
- Tests protect the system when code changes later

This makes the system safer, easier to change, and more professional.
## Day 6 – Persistence (Reading/Writing Files)

I changed the system to load appointments from a JSON file instead of hard-coded data.

The app now:
- Reads input from `data/appointments.json`
- Prints a daily report
- Saves a report to `data/daily-report.txt`

This is the start of a real backend workflow: input → processing → output.
## Day 7 – Config-Driven Filtering

I updated the appointment loader to accept configuration and filter data at load time.

Key takeaways:
- Functions that depend on config must be passed config consistently
- Tests quickly exposed wiring mistakes
- Filtering early simplifies later logic
## Day 8 – Error Handling & Validation

I added explicit error handling for file reading and JSON parsing.
Tests helped expose:
- syntax mistakes
- mismatched expectations vs behavior
- filesystem assumptions in test environments

Key lesson:
Tests must reflect real behavior, not imagined rules.
## Day 9 – Service Layer

I moved revenue calculation into a dedicated service.

Why this matters:
- index.js now coordinates instead of calculating
- business logic lives in one place
- changes are safer and easier to reason about
## Day 10 – Contracts & Validation

I added an appointment validation contract and enforced it in the data-loading layer.

Key takeaways:
- validation belongs at system boundaries
- services should assume valid data
- tests caught structural mistakes quickly
# Day 11 – Appointment Status Model

I created a state machine for appointments with explicit allowed transitions.
This adds guardrails that prevent invalid business behavior (like completing a canceled appointment).
I wrote tests to prove valid transitions are allowed and invalid ones are blocked.
# day 12 
I added a service layer that orchestrates appointment state changes without embedding business rules. 
The service validates inputs and delegates transitions to the domain layer, keeping responsibilities clean and testable. 
# Day 13 - Persistence    
I added a persistence layer that saves appointment state changes to disk while keeping business rules isolated.    
Services orchestrate updates and persistence, and the domain later remains pure and testable. 
# Day 14 – Reporting as a First-Class Output
Built a reporting service that aggregates appointment data by status.
Learned how missing imports can break services even when tests are correct.
Reporting is now a first-class concern, not an afterthought.
# Day 15 – Weekly Reports
Built weekly reports and a formatter that converts business data into readable owner reports.
Learned how separating data, logic, and presentation makes systems easy to extend.
# Day 15 - Operator Alerts & Metrics
Added KPI-driven metrics and alerting to the reporting system.
Weekly reports now calculate revenue, completion rate, and cancellation rate,
and automatically flag risky business conditions based on thresholds.
# Day 16 — Operator Dashboard v0
Today I built the first operator-facing dashboard for Twin Suns OS.
I combined daily reporting, weekly metrics, and alert evaluation into a single summary that gives a real “at-a-glance” view of the business. This is the kind of output an owner would actually look at instead of digging through raw data.
I also debugged and fixed a real integration issue where alert logic expected a metrics object that didn’t match the weekly report structure. I made the dashboard resilient to different report shapes so it won’t crash when data structures evolve.
# Day 17 — System Alignment & Production Readiness Check

* Reviewed Twin Suns OS end-to-end from an operator perspective to identify gaps between working code and production-safe behavior.
* Audited the dashboard, reporting, and alerting flow to ensure outputs reflect real business decisions rather than internal data structures.
* Identified environment and runtime inconsistencies that could undermine reliability during demos or interviews.
* Confirmed Twin Suns OS should be positioned as an internal operating system and systems-thinking artifact, not a polished SaaS product.
* Aligned build priorities toward stability, determinism, and judgment-driven outputs over additional features.

**Status:** System direction clarified; focus shifted to hardening and reliability ahead of further feature work.
# Day 18 — CLI Stabilization & Defensive Defaults

* Stabilized the operator CLI so it runs deterministically and no longer fails due to environment or filesystem issues.
* Fixed a critical reporting bug caused by incorrect argument types and clarified separation between report generation and persistence.
* Implemented defensive defaults so missing appointment statuses safely normalize to `REQUESTED` instead of breaking reports.
* Ensured report output is predictable and demo-safe by writing to a stable daily report file.
* Locked runtime expectations with `.nvmrc` and resolved tooling issues introduced during machine swap.

**Status:** CLI is stable, predictable, and ready for operator use and interviews.
# Day 19 — Operator Alerts Wired into CLI

* Implemented alert evaluation as a first-class service that determines when the operator should care.
* Wired alert logic into the CLI so decisions are surfaced alongside reports, not buried in data.
* Fixed real-world scoping and data-flow issues by enforcing explicit inputs to alert evaluation.
* Established clean separation between data loading, decision logic, and presentation.
* Verified alerts trigger correctly and print deterministic, operator-readable output.

**Status:** Alerting pipeline works end-to-end; system now signals action instead of just reporting state.
